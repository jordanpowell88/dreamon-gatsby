# About Blake Reynolds

Blake Reynolds is a Christian Music artist from the Grand Raids, MI area and has worked in the music industry since 2006. It wasn’t until January 2018 that Blake launched his solo career with his debut single “No Other Name” followed by several covers and originals including “I Believe” and his hit single “Empty”. 

As an artist, Blake’s singular focus is to mobilize songs to inspire, encourage, and empower listeners while also reverberating truth. He and his producer Jared Marc (Keyboardist and producer for Austin French) are intentional about each song and seek to ensure that the anatomy of every song component accurately portray the love and truth of Christ.

Blake’s music is a fusion of pop and soul with a Christian contemporary vibe. Other comparable artist styles would be Phil Wickham, Tauren Wells, and Micah Tyler. He has performed and worked with artists like: JJ Weeks, Ashes Remain, George Moss, Kaylee and Erica, Lindell Cooley, and more. He has also worked with producers like Glasses Off Productions, Littlebird Big Sound, and Jared Marc.
