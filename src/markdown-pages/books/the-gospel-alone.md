Out of the reformation emerged five doctrines that would shape the protestant church for centuries. These five doctrines are: 1.Sola Scriptura - Scripture Alone 2.Solus Christus - Christ Alone 3.Sola Gratia - Grace Alone 4.Sola Fide - Faith Alone 5.Soli Deo Gloria - The Glory of God Alone. As these five doctrines counterattacked the perverse distortions of biblical truth in the reformerâ€™s day, they can do the same for ours. These pillars of our faith establish foundational truths that if rejected, will result in catastrophic peril to this generation, and sadly, even more so to the generations to come. R. P. Kennedy looks into the future and is driven by the Spirit to take up the Sword the Spirit would wield in one hand, even as he raises a trowel in the other. Wading through that which would bring conflict and stagnation rather than confluence and continuation, he preaches with that sword, prophesies with it, to the four winds of the earth in his generation
