What is the churches vocation? What is the church to be and to do?In this book R. P. Kennedy sets out to answer those questions by looking at the ascension gifts found in Ephesians 4:11-13, showing that the church is to be Apostolic, Prophetic, Evangelistic, Shepherding and Teaching. And when she embraces these gifts given to her from Jesus she will be Christ Made Flesh, Godâ€™s Witness to the World.
